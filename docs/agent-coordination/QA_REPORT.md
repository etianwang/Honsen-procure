# Independent QA Report — T08/T10/P1/Formal Combination

**Date:** 2026-10-16  
**QA branch:** `codex/qa-b203c70-server`  
**Verified baseline:** `b203c70fd83a5dbcdb01fcaf9184d5b9fa9bbd13`  
**Delivered implementation:** `8293ed5172f8caa5dd149cec278ea09f0f1a852e`

## Scope and baseline

- PASS — `git merge-base --is-ancestor 8293ed5172f8caa5dd149cec278ea09f0f1a852e b203c70fd83a5dbcdb01fcaf9184d5b9fa9bbd13` returned `0`; the supplied clean handoff contains the delivered implementation.
- PASS — QA ran in an independent worktree from `b203c70`; the source worktree's pre-existing untracked native/E2E SQLite data was not copied, opened, altered or removed.
- PASS — Node `v24.18.0`, WSL Ubuntu Docker Engine 29.9.0, Compose 5.6.0 and Buildx 0.38.0 were verified. `npm ci` completed with 0 vulnerabilities.

## Fresh PostgreSQL evidence

Each official run used the isolated Compose project `honsen-qa-b203c70-20261016` and first executed:

```text
docker compose --project-name honsen-qa-b203c70-20261016 --env-file .env.test -f compose.test.yaml down --volumes
docker compose --project-name honsen-qa-b203c70-20261016 --env-file .env.test -f compose.test.yaml up -d --wait
```

The PostgreSQL 16 container was healthy before execution. Its only database was the test-only `POSTGRES_TEST_DATABASE`; no production connection string, existing E2E SQLite database, `honsen-dev`, or other Compose project was used.

| Check | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Full server Vitest suite | PASS — 14 files, 92/92 tests | `test-results/qa-b203c70-server-full-fresh.log` |
| Builder's combination group | PASS — 6 files, 57/57 tests | `test-results/qa-b203c70-server-combination-57.log` |
| Migration chain `001`–`006` including both ordered `005` migrations | PASS — `migration-runner.test.ts` validates the migrated foundation and repeatable runner | combination group |
| Formal registry backfill and rollback | PASS — `formal-issue-migration.test.ts` proves legacy rows are retained and duplicate legacy formal numbers abort under a savepoint without leaving the registry table | combination group |
| RFQ / formal frozen-state regression | PASS — `postgres-store.test.ts`, `formal-issue.test.ts`, and `formal-issue-hardening.test.ts` | combination group |
| Cross-account and installation-origin isolation | PASS — store test rejects replay result retrieval from another authenticated account/origin; legacy unattested origin fails closed. Full suite additionally covers binding Push installation to the authenticated session rather than request `deviceId`. | full suite and combination group |

Official command used for the full suite:

```text
node ../../node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs run
```

It was invoked from `apps/server` by a temporary ignored QA runner while Compose and the Windows Node process shared one foreground WSL session. This avoids the known host lifecycle interruption without changing application code or test behavior.

## Failure classification

- ENVIRONMENT (not a product failure): two initial full-suite attempts received PostgreSQL `57P01`/`57P03` because the local WSL Docker host stopped after its launching session exited. Their later assertion failures were cascading connection failures, not data pollution or implementation regressions.
- PASS after mitigation: the official fresh-container full run had no connection interruption, no skipped PostgreSQL tests, and no failures. The 57-test targeted rerun was also clean.
- DATA POLLUTION: not observed in either official run. Both began after scoped `down --volumes`; no existing user E2E data was cleaned.

## Acceptance boundary

This report accepts only the completed server/migration verification batch. It does **not** close P1 or Formal integration holds and provides **no** evidence to close `T10-SEC-001`: real Tauri A/B login, Push/Pull conflict/replay, old-token and reconnect isolation remain a separate native-client batch. No application source, schema, migration or security rule was changed by QA.
